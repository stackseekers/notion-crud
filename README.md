## What You Need

Before you start, make sure you have:

1. **A Notion account** (free) - [Sign up here](https://notion.so)
2. **A Netlify account** (free) - [Sign up here](https://app.netlify.com)
3. **Your Notion database** (the one you want to turn into a website)
4. **About 30 minutes** to complete the setup

> **💡 Pro Tip**: If you don't have a Notion database yet, you can create one or duplicate an existing template to get started quickly!

## Step-by-Step Setup

### Step 1: Get Your Notion Database

**Option A: If you have a database link to duplicate:**

1. **Click the database link** you received
2. **Look for "Duplicate" button** in the top right corner of the page
3. **Click "Duplicate"** to copy it to your workspace
4. **Choose your workspace** where you want to save it
5. **Click "Duplicate"** to confirm
6. **You now have your own copy** - this is the database you'll use

**Option B: If you already have your own database:**

1. **Open your existing Notion database** (the one you want to turn into a website)

**For both options, continue with these steps:**

7. **Make sure it has the columns you want** (Name, Email, Phone, etc.)
8. **Optional**: If you have sensitive information, add "(Private)" to the column name
   - Example: "Email (Private)" will hide the actual email addresses
9. **Copy the database ID** from the URL:
   - Look at your Notion database URL
   - Copy the long string of letters and numbers after the last slash
   - Example: `https://notion.so/workspace/a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-...`
   - The ID is: `a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-...`

**Note**: If you don't see a "Duplicate" button on a shared link, ask the owner to share the database with you first.

### Step 2: Create a Notion Integration

Create a secure connection between your website and Notion:

1. **Visit**: [Notion Integrations](https://www.notion.so/my-integrations)
2. **Click**: "New integration"
3. **Fill out the form**:
   - **Name**: "My Website App" (or whatever you prefer)
   - **Workspace**: Select your workspace
4. **Click**: "Submit"
5. **Copy the token** (starts with `secret_`) - save this for later!
6. **Share your database** with the integration:
   - Return to your Notion database
   - Click "Share" in the top right corner
   - Click "Invite"
   - Search for "My Website App" (or your chosen name)
   - Click "Invite"

> **🔒 Security Note**: Keep your integration token safe - it's like a password that allows your website to access your Notion database.

### Step 3: Deploy Your Website to Netlify

Deploy your website using Netlify's free hosting service:

1. **Visit**: [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com)
2. **Sign up** for a free account (if you don't have one)
3. **Click**: "New site from Git"
4. **Choose**: "GitHub" (you'll need to connect your GitHub account)
5. **Select**: This repository (the one you downloaded)
6. **Click**: "Deploy site"
7. **Wait** for deployment to complete (usually 2-3 minutes)

> **🚀 Deployment Tip**: Netlify will automatically build and deploy your website. You'll get a unique URL like `https://amazing-app-123456.netlify.app`

### Step 4: Connect Your Notion Database

Link your Notion database to your website:

1. **In Netlify**, navigate to your new website
2. **Click**: "Site settings"
3. **Click**: "Environment variables"
4. **Add these two variables**:
   - **Name**: `NOTION_API_KEY`  
     **Value**: `secret_your_token_here` (paste the token from Step 2)
   - **Name**: `NOTION_DATABASE_ID`  
     **Value**: `your_database_id_here` (paste the ID from Step 1)
5. **Click**: "Save"
6. **Return** to your website dashboard
7. **Click**: "Trigger deploy" → "Deploy site"

> **⚙️ Configuration Note**: Environment variables are like settings that tell your website how to connect to your Notion database securely.

### Step 5: Enable File Uploads (Optional)

Enable file upload functionality for your website:

1. **Wait** for the deployment to complete
2. **Navigate to**: Site settings → Functions
3. **Scroll down** to "Netlify Blobs" section
4. **Click**: "Enable" (if not already enabled)
5. **Redeploy** your site

> **📁 File Upload Note**: Netlify Blobs provides secure file storage. Once enabled, users can upload documents, images, and other files directly through your website.
